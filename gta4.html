            I replayed this gem of a game again after about 15 years, when I
            played it first as a kid. And I must say this game still holds up.
            Arguably, it has the best story in any GTA game. <br />
            The story follows the life of Niko Bellic, who comes to Liberty City
            in search of a new life. Niko is a former armyman and the horrors of
            war haunts him throughout the game. <br />
            What makes this game more unique from other GTA titles is that this
            game follows a more dark and grim story of a criminal. Here are some
            of the features of this game:

              I just love the Grand Theft Auto series as a whole but GTA 4 holds
              a special place in my heart. Niko Bellic, a flawed but charming
              protagonist with other supporting characters makes this game one
              of my favourite of all time.
